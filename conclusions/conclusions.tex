A brief introduction

\section{Research Conclusions}
\subsubsection{\nameref{chapter:continuous_compost_bomb}}

In \cref{chapter:continuous_compost_bomb} I investigated the the effect of adding a vertical spatial dimension to the compost bomb instability.
The purpose of this was twofold. 
Firstly, I was interested to see if the instability still existed in a more realistic model.
Secondly, I wanded to know if certain wildfires could be caused by biogeochemical heating and in order to do this more realistic physics was desirable.

In order to investigate this, I created a partial differential equation model of soil temperature which included biogeochemical heating. I made the assumption
that soil carbon could be viewed as being time invariant, which placed the model into the `compost bomb limit' of~\cite{Luke2011}. This came at the cost of preventing
R-tipping so the potential for B-tipping was investigated. Furthermore the effect of a large seasonal cycle in atmospheric temperatures on the soil was investigated.

It was shown that for sufficently large atmospheric temperatures the model had no steady state. This meant that the soil temperatures had diverged and that a compost bomb
had occured. If, as in the real world, soil carbon were allowed to evolve dynamically then the amount of soil carbon would decrease which would prevent the soil temperatures from diverging;
instead they would simply reach a large value.

It was also shown that a sufficently large seasonal cycle --- which could be realised by a summer heat wave --- would be enough to trigger a compost bomb.
Furthermore, the size of the seasonal cycle was not dissimilar to the seasonal cycles observed in parts of Siberia (as shown in \cref{fig:seasonal_cycle_maps}).
This can be seen as evidence that Siberian wildfires may be caused, in part, by biogeochemical heating.

Due to the approximation that soil carbon was constant in time, the compost bomb instability became an example of B-tipping rather than R-tipping. It does not necessarily
follow that the system would experience R-tipping if this approximation was relaxed. However, it is reasonable to assume that the vertical diffusion of heat would not be a barrier to
R-tipping, as long as the atmospheric temperatures were raised rapidly compared to the soil carbon timescale, due to the significant timescale separation between the soil thermal and
carbon timescales \parencite{Luke2011}.

The approximation that soil carbon is constant is accurate over the timescales of a year, given the decadal turnover time of soil carbon \parencite{Varney2020}.
It follows therefore, that there can be good confidence about the results to do with the seaonal cycle. However, the applicability to the phenomenon of wildfires is more doubtful.
This is because it may be better to view a hot summer period as a more temporally compact perturbation to atmospheric temperatures, rather than an amplified sinusoid. This case has
since been studied by~\cite{OSullivan2023} for the model of~\cite{Luke2011}. They also found for realistic Siberian summer temperatures compost bombs were possible. 

To summarise, in \cref{chapter:continuous_compost_bomb} I managed to show that adding in the vertical diffusion of heat does not suppress the compost bomb. This therefore increases the confidence
that the effect is real. Furthermore I also showed that a hot summer, as modeled by a large seasonal cycle of temperature, could cause compost bombs, which has applications to the
problem of Siberian wildfires.

\subsubsection{\nameref*{chapter:global_bomb}}

The investigation into the role of biogeochemical heating was continued in \cref{chapter:global_bomb}. Instead of looking at the local effect of biogeochemical heating,
the effect at the global scale was considered. This was motivated by the fact that the extra carbon released by biogeochemical heating would increase atmospheric temperatures,
further increasing respiration. This positive feedback therefore increases the chances of triggereing a compost bomb, and it is thus important to quantify.\todo{I can write this better}

In order to do this, the model of~\cite{Luke2011} was assumed to hold at the global scale, meaning quanitites could be replaced with their globally averaged values. The air temperature
was set to scale logarithmically with atmospheric \ce{CO2}, which in turn was calculated through carbon conservation. The additional effect of \ce{CO2} fertilisation was considered,
by assuming Net Primary Productivity was a saturating function of atmospheric carbon. The role of the ocean was accounting for very simply, by assuming that a fixed fraction of
carbon emissions become ocean carbon, which is equivalent to scaling down the flux from the land to the atmosphere by a fixed amount.

The stability of this model was investigated first. To do this its bifurcation diagram was computed and it was found that there was a bifurcation if the climate sensitivity was large enough
or the biogeochemical heating was strong enough. The model was simple enough that the location of the bifurcation point could be computed analytically. The effect of linearly increasing
atmospheric carbon was then investigated, where it was shown numerically that R-tipping could occur and contribution to atmospheric \ce{CO2} from biogeochemical heating was quantified.

It was found that for realistic amounts of biogeochemical heating, only a small difference to the stability of the system was made. It was however striking, that when there was no
\ce{CO2} fertilisation, the system was unstable at comparatively low levels of climate sensitivity. These levels are low enough to be in the range of CMIP models. It is therefore interesting to note
that without \ce{CO2} fertilisation the Earth's carbon and thus climate system may not be stable.

The critical rates of emissions required to trigger a compost bomb in this system was also determined. It was found that these critical rates far exceeded anything humanity was likely to be able
to emit. Furthermore contribution to atmospheric \ce{CO2} was found to be small. It was however interesting to note that \ce{CO2} decreased these critical rates and increased the impact of
biogeochemical heating on carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Furthermore, it was found that there was an `optimal' climate sensitivity which maximised the impact of biogeochemical heating
on carbon emissions at that this optimum occured at plausible values of the climate sensitivity.
