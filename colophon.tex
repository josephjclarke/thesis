  \textsc{Colophon}

  This thesis was typeset using \LaTeX{}, developed by Leslie Lamport based on Donald Knuth's \TeX{}.
  The typesetting owes a debt to Robert Bringhurst's \emph{The Elements of Typographic Style}.

  The typeface was EBGaramond-maths, assembled by Clea F. Rees. This extends EB Garamond,
  designed by Georg Mayr-Duffner and Octavio Pardo, for mathematical use. Calligraphic
  symbols came from Knuth's computer modern.

  The title page, passed onto me by Rebecca Varney, has its origins lost in the mists of time. It was typeset in Helvetica,
  which was designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann.
